Description: Functions, data and user interfaces for performing physiologically
    based pharmacokinetic ('PBPK') modeling, in-vitro-to-in-vivo Extrapolation
    ('IVIVE') and exposure estimation. Also contains user interfaces to run
    models from the 'httk' package. Taken together these provide an easy to use
    and powerful modeling tool that can be used for all steps along
    the source-to-outcome continuum.All the analysis tools in the package are
    run as interactive applications. Check package help for more
    information. Refer to the manuscript 'Population Life-course exposure to
    health effects model (PLETHEM): An R package for PBPK modeling'
    <doi: 10.1016/j.comtox.2019.100115> for more information on the models and
    algorithms used in the package. More information on PBPK modeling itself
    can be found in the book 'Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling:
    Science and Applications' by Reddy et al <doi:10.1002/0471478768>.
