Please write TRUE and FALSE instead of T and F. (Please don't use "T" or "F" as vector names.)

\dontrun{} should only be used if the example really cannot be executed (e.g. because of missing additional software, missing API keys, ...) by the user. That's why wrapping examples in \dontrun{} adds the comment ("# Not run:") as a warning for the user.
                    Does not seem necessary.
                    Please unwrap the examples if they are executable in < 5 sec, or replace \dontrun{} with \donttest{}.
                    
                    Functions which are supposed to only run interactively (e.g. shiny) should be wrapped in if(interactive()).
                    Please replace /dontrun{} with if(interactive()){} if possible, then users can see that the functions are not intended for use in scripts / functions that are supposed to run non interactively.
                    
                    Please also add a few small executable examples in your Rd-files if possible, to illustrate the use of the exported function but also enable automatic testing.
                    
                    Please ensure that your functions do not write by default or in your examples/vignettes/tests in the user's home filespace (including the package directory and getwd()). This is not allowed by CRAN policies.
Please omit any default path in writing functions.
In your examples/vignettes/tests you can write to tempdir().

Please do not modify the global environment (e.g. by using <<-) in your functions. This is not allowed by the CRAN policies.

Please ensure that you do not use more than 2 cores in your examples, vignettes, etc.

Please do not set a seed to a specific number within a function.

Please always add all authors, contributors and copyright holders in the Authors@R field with the appropriate roles.
